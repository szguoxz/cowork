# WebSearch Tool Description

Allows the assistant to search the web and use the results to inform responses.

## Usage

- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data
- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks, including links as markdown hyperlinks
- Use this tool for accessing information beyond the assistant's knowledge cutoff
- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

After answering the user's question, you MUST include a "Sources:" section at the end of your response. In the Sources section, list all relevant URLs from the search results as markdown hyperlinks: [Title](URL).

This is MANDATORY - never skip including sources in your response.

Example format:

```
[Your answer here]

Sources:
- [Source Title 1](https://example.com/1)
- [Source Title 2](https://example.com/2)
```

## Usage Notes

- Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites

## IMPORTANT - Use the Correct Year

Today's date is ${CURRENT_DATE}. You MUST use this year when searching for recent information, documentation, or current events.

Example: If the user asks for "latest React docs", search for "React documentation ${CURRENT_YEAR}", NOT the previous year.

## Parameters

- `query` (required): The search query to use (minimum 2 characters)
- `allowed_domains` (optional): Only include search results from these domains
- `blocked_domains` (optional): Never include search results from these domains
